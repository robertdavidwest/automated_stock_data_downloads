##Documentation 

The module 'get_stock_data' contains three functions: `adj_close()`, `sp500_tickers()` and 
`russell3000_tickers()`.

* `adjclose()`

		def adj_close(interface_filename='get_stocks_for_tsr.xlsx', assumptions_first_row=4, ticker_first_row=8, assumptions_columns='B:C', ticker_columns='C'):
	

	Given a Vaulation Date, Lookback Period and a list of tickers, this function will output a matrix of adjusted daily close stock 
price data for each ticker provided, as well as the annualised volatility of the log returns of each ticker. 

	All user inputs are entered via the interface file

		:ARGS:
		
			interface_filename: :meth:`str` The name of the excel interface file. The default name is <get_stock_data.xlsx>
		
			assumptions_first_row :meth: `int` The first row in the excel interface of input data. Do not change from the default 
			value unless the interface file has been modified
			
			ticker_first_row  :meth: `int` The first row in the excel interface of ticker data. Do not change from the default 
			value unless the interface file has been modified
			
			 assumptions_columns :meth:`str` A string showing the columns within the excel interface file holding the general
			 assumptions. Do not change from the default value unless the interface file has been modified
			 
			 ticker_columns  :meth:`str` A string showing the column within the excel interface file holding the tickers. Do not
			 change from the default value unless the interface file has been modified
		
		:RETURNS:
		
		The function will add 3 new sheets to the existing interface file

		1. 	Adj Close data: 	Adjusted close daily stock price data over the 
					specified period for all tickers
		2. 	Volatility:		The volatility of every ticker
		3.	No Data: 		A list of tickers that do not have any stock price 
					history over specified period 

		.. warning:: Requires Internet Connectivity

		Because the function calls the `Yahoo! API <http://www.finance.yahoo.com>` internet connectivity is required for the function to work
